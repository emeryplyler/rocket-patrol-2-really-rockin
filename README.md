# Modded Rocket Patrol
This repository holds the source code for a parody of Rocket Patrol made for CMPM 120 at UCSC. It is one of my earliest game projects. I created it using some base code for a primitive shooter game which was then
expanded upon and reskinned.

A deployed version can be found on my itch.io page [here](https://eply.itch.io/rocket-patrol-normal).
